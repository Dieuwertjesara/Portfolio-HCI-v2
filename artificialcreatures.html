                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>This topic is called Artificial Creatures. Artificial Creatures are litteraly explained things that are man made and behave in a living manner. This can be present in all kinds of things. The most common thing to think of is a robot. It's an electronic product made up off all kinds of materials and is man made. The way the robot is programmed however can make it "alive". We as humans have the tendency to project our own emotional range onto objects, even objects that aren't responsive or interactive. This can be magnified by adding responses and interaction. Et voila, an artificial creature.</p>

                <h2>The homeostasis model of an automatic sliding door</h2>
                <div style="padding-top:70.000%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://gifer.com/embed/7ikW" width="100%" height="100%" style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://gifer.com">via GIFER</a></p>

                    An automatic sliding door seems at first glance to be just a lifeless door. An object. So how would this be classified as an artificial creature then? This fenomanon can be explained with the homeostasis model. The homeostasis model is used to identify needs.

                    An automatic sliding door had needs? Yep.No not needs like food, shelter and water. Let me explain.

                    The first thing the door would need is power. A door without any power source won't move on it's own. The door is now powered but it still needs something to actually move. It needs machenical parts to be able to slide open or to close, just like a regular sliding door. That's not all ofcourse because this one is automatic. So it needs a trigger to act upon. This can be done by a movement sensor or perhaps an infrared sensor to know when people want the door to slide open.

                    Lastly to make it work well it has to be programmed right. If the door gets a signal from one of the sensors but doesn't know what to do when that happens it will still function badly.

                    All of these needs have to be met for the door to work well. If one of these needs isn't met the door can get "confused" or do something totaly different than it's supposed to. This is why it can be viewed as an artificial creature. The way it responds in situations is preprogrammed, but it's the door that acts on information it gets from the enviroment. It decides based on all it's needs what it does. This way on a very basic level it (looks like it) "thinks".

                    When the first smart home products and elements started being sold they weren't always very practical or functioning. It was often a nice gimmick and most people did not think they would ever use it or even feel the need to have it. Now we don't even bat an eye when people have an Echo, Alexa or Google nest in their home. Everyone has used and eventually stopped using there phones AI assistent and knows if it's usefull for there lives or not. I think the google home mini is a good example for an object that on the outside doesn't look like a living thing but still feels like it. This is because of the google assistant that comes with it. If it's not used it's just a grey or black blob shaped speaker, but if you say Hey google! it responds to it and waits for your command. Once you tell it to for example turn off the lights it responds with a human voice to confirm the command and if your lights are connected to the network it turns them off.
                    This device suddenly seems like a living and thinking creature that can perform actions and respond to triggers.
                    That we can go very far with projecting our human characteristics on objects can be seen as soon as your google home mini starts to respond even when you haven't said anything resembeling the trigger words hey google, or ok google. This in a lot of cases makes people feel slightly uncomfortable, because it's behaving to much alive. As if it is thinking on it's own.
                    This does differ per person. Some people get the same feeling when a door opens on it's own because of wind. Some people just see it as a malfunctioning electronic device. It also differs per product. If my google home mini starts talking out of the blue I see it as coming alive, but when an automatic door keeps opening without someone walking by I just view it as a broken door.

                    I think this subject is more complicated then it seems at first. I used the homeostasis model for the automatic sliding door and had to convince myself that this kind of door can be viewed as an artificial creature. Part of me believes that, but part of me does not. The door behaves based on triggers, but these triggers are pre defined by the programm written behind it. When I walk up to an automatic sliding door I do somehow feel like it's more "alive" thus more creature like than a normal door. However I don't feel the same about an automatic door that opens when I push a button. This to me is a bit strange, because I know that weather you use a button a a sensor trigger it's still the same principle. Yet I don't experience the same. I think the question: "Is this a creature?" is on some level subjective. Something very basic can be percieved as way more alive then something very detailled. It's all about how you interact with it. </p>
