                <h2>AR/VR</h2>
                <p>AR stands for Augmented Reality and VR for Virtual Reality. Augmented Reality means it's an altered version of the real world. It's a combination of artificual elements augmented onto real world elements. Virtual reality is is also an altered reality, but this time it's a complete virtual world and it had little to no connection to the reality the user is in at that moment. With virtual reality you can completely transform a users enviroment and with augmented reality you can for example enhance the already present reality of the user. Augmented reality is for example used on phone apps where there is an extra layer over the camera output, like snapchat filters or the pokemon go app that lets you catch pokemon in the wild. Virtual reality would besides a phone or other type of screen also require for example a vr headset to fully emerge the user into the virtual worls.
                    <br><br>
                    To explore this subject further I've come up with 3 new AR and VR concepts.</p>
                <h2>Assignment</h2>
                <p> </p>
                <p>
                    <h1>Sports/movement</h1>
                    <p>I hate excersizing just because I "have to". I'm not alone in this. A lot of people struggle with not excsersizing enough and name insecurity as a reason. My concept would be a VR application that is connected to workout equipment. By closing off from the outside and no one, not even you, seeing what you do can be very reasuring. This would be enhanced by emerging the user in a virtual world where you have to race mario on the rainbow road or fly trough the sky with a bike with wings. Getting in the zone trough a virtual story or game would make time fly and get you in the zone in no time.</p>

                    <img src="img/ar-vr_concept1" alt="Visual for Sports/Movement concept" id="incomplete">
                    <h1>Public transport</h1>
                    <p>My concept for this subject would be an AR function on excisting public transport apps. Something that is very hard with public transport is knowing exactly where to be, especially if it's a big city and you're new to it. At the station I use frequently, The hague HS trainstation, you have lots of trams, busses and trains. When you get to the tram platform there are multiple spots where your tram could be. This is indicated by letters, but this isn't always clear. I still, as a native born and raised Hagenees, have trouble with knowing where to be. With apps like 9292 you already have the google maps route for walking to the right place, but for a location like The hague HS it just directs you to the middle of all the connected platforms. The platforms are quite far from eachother, so one wrong decision means missing your tram. The AR function would, based on your chosen route, visually show you which one you need based on your camera view.</p>
                    <img src="img/ar-vr_concept2" alt="Visual for Public transport concept" id="incomplete">
                    <h1>Car technology</h1>
                    <p>I like the added value of VR and AR for games the most so another game like concept. I think normal driving should not be combined with AR or VR but driving for fun with go karts would be amazing. Having an overlay or going all the way and having portable VR gear on while in a go kart means being able to take VR or AR gaming to the next level. Actually seeing your favourite racing games come to live and being in it while also having the adrenaline rush of real live racing in a go kart. I don't think there is a more immersive gaming experience than that.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Research</h1>
                    <p id="incomplete">
                        Research. Look for fun / interesting / impressive projects. Try to find background
                        information about the project, just a YouTube video is not enough. Describe (75 to
                        150 words) what the project entails and what you like / find interesting / impressive
                        about it. Also mention the name(s) of the creator(s) and provide a link.
