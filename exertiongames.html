                <p>This topic is about Playfyl Interaction. It is a method you can use to make the user of your product or survice interact with it in a playful and fun way. This can be a benifit as it makes users more inclined and motivated to try or something. It can help with feeling rewarded and can also be the reason for a user to keep coming back to a product or service. This method of designing or creating is often used in the making of games. To understand this topic better I've made a new concept for a social playful interface to encourage positive behaviour within the main building of The Hague University of Applied Science.</p>
                <h1>Assignment</h1>
                <p>
                My concept is based on behaviour I personally witness a lot when I visit the main THUAS building. Every day big groups of students have to make it to class and a lot of them use the elevators. Because my classes are always on the 6th 7th or 8th floor this usually includes me aswell. What often annoys me and probably other people is the amount of people that crowd the elevators for just 1 or 2 floors up or down. I myself now try to take the stairs most of the time, the wait is sometimes as long as just walking up 6 flights of stairs, but it's very unmotivating to get to your floor and see the elevator arrive at the same time or earlier. It's hard to stick to the good habbit without a little reward. This calls for some added playfullnes. 
                <br><br>
                To do this I would add a simple points and rewards system. The game would be able to differentiate between people taking the elevator and people taking the stairs, and the amount of floors is also important. When you take the stairs, you get points per floor. Every extra floor will be a higher bonus then the one before, so when you take the stairs for 1 floor you get 5 points, but taking 2 flights of stairs will be 15 points, making the second flight of stairs worth 10 points and so on. If you take the elevator instead you'll get points deducted. These are actually the other way around. If you take the elevator from tthe ground floor all the way up to the 8th floor you don't get points deducted. The 8th floor is a hell of a lot to walk by stairs so that's okay. The deducting starts when you take the elevator for less than 6 floors. It starts small, with 5 points off for 5 floor travelled by elevator and increases per floor the same as with the stairs.
                <br><br>
                It would look like this: <br><br>
                <img src="img/playful-interaction-concept.jpg">
                The idea is that you can battle classmates or friends for higher scores. I'm not a fan of overall high scores because I feel it's very demotivating to see these often crazy high scores because some people either go nuts or cheat. Behaviour should be rewarded for everyone and not just the top of the list. I do think making pools with friends or classmates would be fun, but only with people who want to join ofcourse. With the rewards I think fun things would be free small stuff like a free soup at the cantine or maybe an extra stamp for your coffee card to get to a free one quicker. I would not use things like discounts because that simply doesn't feel like a real reward if you have to both walk a lot of stairs and still pay for stuff you might not even like that much. 
                
                The game would not use your location as an input but would have sensors on floors and by the stairs/elevators. This way it would know if you are on the first or second floor and so on and if it was at the staircase, the sensors would be between floors so you can't cheat without at least going up half the stairs, or on the elevator.
                Using the phone location would not work well enough, I think, because the staircases and elevators are right next to eachother.
